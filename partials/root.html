  <h3>Welcome to the Terapeak.Intake.Center</h3>

  <p>The Terapeak Intake Center is a modified tool from <a href="http://pointnorth.io">PointNorth</a> to assist in the project intake process. The Intake Center focuses on the <a href="http://pointnorth.io/#content-strategy">Content Strategy</a> of new projects. Every project, from small brochure sites to large webapps all have a core set of intake requirements that need to be determined before development work can begin. Designed as the deliverable for these core requirements, Intake Center aims to make it easy to ensure these deliverables for Content Strategy are complete and available before development starts. To start, please enter your Project's Name:</p>

  <input type="text" ng-model="project.name"  placeholder="Add Project's Name">

  <p>Intake Center is divided into four sections:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Roles - (from <a href="http://pointnorth.io/#roles-and-responsibilities">Roles and Responsibilities</a>)</li>
    <li>Vision Statement - (from <a href="http://pointnorth.io/#project-vision">Project Vision</a>)</li>
    <li>User Personas - (from <a href="http://pointnorth.io/#user-personas">User Personas</a>)</li>
    <li>Content Models - (from <a href="http://pointnorth.io/#content-modeling">Content Modeling</a>)</li>
    <!-- <li>Information Architecture - (from <a href="http://pointnorth.io/#information-architecture">Information Architecture</a>)</li> -->
  </ol>

  <p>Intake Center's Project Roles (from <a href="http://pointnorth.io/#roles-and-responsibilities">Roles and Responsibilities</a>) section should be a living document that builds up as the team is formed. It will most likely start with the <a href="http://pointnorth.io/#product-owner">Product Owner</a> and <a href="http://pointnorth.io/#project-manager">Project Manager</a> roles, as well as any other roles that are needed initially. As other team members become available and are added to the project, their roles and responsibilities should be included.</p>

  <p>Neither <a href="http://pointnorth.io/#content-inventory">content inventory</a> nor <a href="http://pointnorth.io/#content-audit">content audit</a> are direct deliverables and as such, they are not included in this tool; however, they should absolutely still be completed prior to Content Modeling in order to get an understanding of a project's content for the Content Models.</p>
